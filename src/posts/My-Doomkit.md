I've been meaning to write this for years now and I've finally got the motivation. Here's how I play and organize Doom and it's many, many mods.

![Top Level Folder](/pics/doomkit.png)

I use [this fork of ZDoom Launcher](https://github.com/lcferrum/qzdl) to launch mods, and create .zdl files to quickly open the games I want. Especially useful for conversions.

![My WADs Folder](/pics/wads.png)

Here's how I organize my WADs. The IWADs directory holds all the classic wads to patch (Doom, Heretic, Chex Quest). The doom_complete wad was made with [Wadsmoosh](https://jp.itch.io/wadsmoosh) and contains all the classic Doom episodes.

![Map WADs](/pics/map_wads.png)

For each WAD, I keep a folder with the name of the wad and in the folder I put in whatever came with the download. If it only comes with a wad file, I also like to add an internet shortcut to where I downloaded the mod from.

![Source Ports](/pics/sourcep.png)

The Source Ports I have. I mainly use [GZDoom](https://www.zdoom.org/index) and keep the rest for fun.

![Utilities](/pics/doom_util.png)

Various tools I keep on hand.

![standalones](/pics/standalones.png)

The Standalones folder is where I keep the Doom mods that come as a standalone download with their own preconfigured engine or whatever.

![POOM](/pics/poom.png)

I even keep a downloaded copy of the [PICO-8 demake of Doom.](https://freds72.itch.io/poom)

I want you to know that I encourage people to get into Doom mods. There's a lot of cool stuff out there. By the way, I also keep a similar setup for Build Engine games (Duke Nukem, Blood) and Quake. Maybe I could do a similar post on those.
