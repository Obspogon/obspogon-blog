Ever since Deltarune Chapter 2 dropped I haven't stopped thinking about it so here's some assorted thoughts. Spoilers.

**This is a very old post, made before I made _this_ blog.**

### Berdly will return

People have been wondering if Berdly will return or not due to the Weird Route, some believing that by having a route where he dies, he can't be too important to the story. I think the Weird Route proves he will be a little important. After all, it would be _weird_ if an important character dies.

I only said he'd be a _little_ important, though. He'll probably mostly be comic relief, like how he was in Chapter 2.

### Potential Irony

Susie mistakes Noelle's crush on her as being onto them and the Dark World. What if Ralsei's crush _is_ actually being onto Kris being possessed and/or dead? He already blushes based on the SOUL.

### Sans could be in on the Vessel

I remember something about the Vessel creation sequence having unused strings that sound like a grocery shopping list. And we know how important unused strings are to the lore (tm).

### Toriel might know about the Kris SOUL thing.

Not the full picture, of course, but might know that they rip it out.

### Dess is severely ill

Enough to not be at home, but not dead. Based off a video about Noelle that also noted her line about everything in the Dark World being cured with a single spell.
