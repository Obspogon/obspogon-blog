<p>I've been meaning to write this for years now and I've finally got the motivation. Here's how I play and organize Doom and it's many, many mods.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/lcferrum/qzdl">this fork of ZDoom Launcher</a> to launch mods, and create .zdl files to quickly open the games I want. Especially useful for conversions.</p>

<img src="/pics/wads.png" alt="My WADs Folder" />
<p>Here's how I organize my WADs. The IWADs directory holds all the classic wads to patch (Doom, Heretic, Chex Quest). The doom_complete wad was made with <a href="https://jp.itch.io/wadsmoosh">Wadsmoosh</a> and contains all the classic Doom episodes.</p>

<img src="/pics/map_wads.png" alt="Map WADs" />
<p>For each WAD, I keep a folder with the name of the wad and in the folder I put in whatever came with the download. If it only comes with a wad file, I also like to add an internet shortcut to where I downloaded the mod from.</p>

<p>The Source Ports I have. I mainly use <a href="https://www.zdoom.org/index">GZDoom</a> and keep the rest for fun.</p>

<img src="/pics/doom_util.png" alt="Utilities" />
<p>Various tools I keep on hand.</p>

<img src="/pics/standalones.png" alt="standalones" />
<p>The Standalones folder is where I keep the Doom mods that come as a standalone download with their own preconfigured engine or whatever.</p>

<img src="/pics/poom.png" alt="POOM" />
<p>I even keep a downloaded copy of the <a href="https://freds72.itch.io/poom">PICO-8 demake of Doom.</a></p>

<p>I want you to know that I encourage people to get into Doom mods. There's a lot of cool stuff out there. By the way, I also keep a similar setup for Build Engine games (Duke Nukem, Blood) and Quake. Maybe I could do a similar post on those.</p>
