<p>Ever since Deltarune Chapter 2 dropped I haven't stopped thinking about it so here's some assorted thoughts. Spoilers.</p>

<h3>Berdly will return</h3>
<p>People have been wondering if Berdly will return or not due to the Weird Route, some believing that by having a route where he dies, he can't be too important to the story. I think the Weird Route proves he will be a little important. After all, it would be <i>weird</i> if an important character dies.</p>

<p>I only said he'd be a <i>little</i> important, though. He'll probably mostly be comic relief, like how he was in Chapter 2.</p>

<h3>Potential Irony</h3>
<p>Susie mistakes Noelle's crush on her as being onto them and the Dark World. What if Ralsei's crush <i>is</i> actually being onto Kris being possessed and/or dead? He already blushes based on the SOUL.</p>

<h3>Sans could be in on the Vessel</h3>
<p>I remember something about the Vessel creation sequence having unused strings that sound like a grocery shopping list. And we know how important unused strings are to the lore (tm).</p>

<h3>Toriel might know about the Kris SOUL thing.</h3>
<p>Not the full picture, of course, but might know that they rip it out.</p>

<h3>Dess is severely ill</h3>
<p>Enough to not be at home, but not dead. Based off a video about Noelle that also noted her line about everything in the Dark World being cured with a single spell.</p>
